# Donations for free software and faster development of your own search engine


Many small donations together enable us to work more time on this Open-Source project making this Free Software better.


Every donation or to be allowed to open source results of paid jobs means additional time working only on this project, since within such donated development time we have not to spend our time on other closed commercial projects for lunch and living costs.


## Buy licences


For more sustainability and further development, companies, organizations and universities can officially buy open source licences or official packages with printed documentation to support this free software project. Please [contact via e-mail.

## Supporting further development of features for non-profits


Donations additional to some paid licenses, consulting tasks, setups, integrations or module, plugin or connector developments allow us to work on features needed by non-profit organisations like NGOs and journalists for investigative reporting instead of only on other stuff meeting mainly needs of companies.
