# Installation


# Installation on a desktop computer, laptop or notebook running on Linux, Windows or Mac (desktop search)


Single desktop users can use the preconfigured toolbox bundle and virtual machine [Open Semantic Desktop Search](../../desktop_search).

# Installation on an encrypted usb-key


If you have very sensitive documents and want to install a separated search environment, have a look on [InvestigateIX](http://www.mandalka.name/investigateix/).



# Installation on a Linux server (organizations or research teams)


Installation on a Linux server for social search or collaborative research for an organizations or a research team:

[Install Open Semantic Search on a Ubunto or Debian GNU/Linux server](search_server).

## Other Linux distributions



The Debian packages are archives and since Open Semantic Search is Solr and Python and PHP scripts it contain all sources. You can unzip them and copy all directories/files to your filesystem.

Additionally you have to install software or libraries on which the packages depend. You can get a list of the needed tools in the Debian config file of each package or module within the file "*DEBIAN/control*" in the section "depends".


# Install a virtual search server (search appliance for organizations or research teams)


Installation as virtual machine on a virtual maschine host like a Linux or Windows server for virtualization for social search or collaborative research for an organizations or a research team:

[Install Open Semantic Search Appliance on virtual machine (VM) host like Virtual Box](search_appliance).
